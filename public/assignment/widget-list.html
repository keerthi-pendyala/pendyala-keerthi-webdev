    <p>So an Enterprise NoSQL database company called <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228623978&amp;iu=/4246/gm.lifehacker/promotedpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarkLogic</a> teamed up with a cloud-based clinical documentation company called M*Modal to help streamline the process.
    We at Studio@Gizmodo made a video telling the story, illustrated by acclaimed chalk artist CJ Hughes. Check it out and see what your doctor might be using in the future… or even now.</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">The Secret History of the First Cat in Space</h2>

    <p>On October 18th, 1963, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Centre+national+d%E2%80%99%C3%A9tudes&amp;oq=Centre+national+d%E2%80%99%C3%A9tudes&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.260j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre national d’études</a> in France was set to send a small cat named Félix into space. After lagging behind its Soviet and American competitors, France was eager to stake its claim in the space race—with cats, for some reason. But on launch day, the <a href="http://www.monkeyinspace.net/first-animal-in-space/space-cat-felix-felicette/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mischievous little beast</a> went missing—and an accidental heroine stepped in to take his place. Her name was Félicette.<br></p>
    <p>After her landing, French scientists at the  Education Center of Aviation and Medical Research (CERMA) studied Félicette’s brain waves to see if she had changed at all since her voyage. While not much is known about their findings—or about Félicette’s eventual fate—the CERMA <a href="https://user.xmission.com/~emailbox/spacecat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> she had made “a valuable contribution to research.”</p>
