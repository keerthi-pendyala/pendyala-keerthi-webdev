     <H2> <b>Project </b> - <i>TA Office Hours Management System</i>  </H2> <br/>

      <!--<h4>Project Idea</h4>-->
      <!---->

      <!--<br/><br/>-->

      <!--<h4>Technologies and Comparison with existing systems</h4>-->
      <!--<b>Technology</b>  <br/>-->
      <!--I would like to implement this as a MEAN stack web application using Google Distance Matrix and MBTA APIs <br/>-->

      <!--<b>Existing Systems</b> <br/>-->
      <!--1) Google Maps shows the fastest route and the transport options available. However there is no comparison between these-->
      <!--options at a quick glance. The user has to mentally calculate if he will make it on time to catch the train and switch-->
      <!--between tabs while doing so.<br/>-->

      <!--<b>Key Benefits</b> <br/>-->
      <!--1) Designed to help NU students evaluate the quickest possible mode of transport in the vicinity of the campus.<br/>-->
      <!--2) A indication of whether they will reach on time to catch the train/bus is useful in making this choice.<br/><br/>-->

    <!--<h4>MockUps</h4>-->

    <!--<img src="../img/nutransit01.jpeg" alt="picture-05" height="500" width="500">-->



      <h4>Link to prototype</h4>

      Our Project can be cloned from  <a href = "https://github.ccs.neu.edu/keerthi/cs5340-project.git">here</a>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h4>StartUp instructions</h4>

      <b>Access the website on heroku :</b>
      <br/>
      To login as student visit - https://tohms.herokuapp.com/project/#/home
      <br/>
      To login as TA visit - https://tohms.herokuapp.com/project/#/taHome

      <br/>
      <br/>


      <b>Alternatively, use git to clone and run on local system:</b>
      <br/>
      1. Clone the git repository mentioned above using - git clone https://github.ccs.neu.edu/keerthi/cs5340-project.git

      <br/>

      2. This is a private repository, you won&#39;t have access to it unless we add you as collaborator. Please email your
         git.ccs.neu.edu id to us at - keerthi@ccs.neu.edu or kmcarol26@ccs.neu.edu as soon as possible for I7 testing.

      <br/>

      3. Once you obtained access and successfully cloned the project, on the terminal switch to cs5340-project
         folder by typing : cd cs5340-project

      <br/>

      4. run the command : npm install

      <br/>

      5. run the command : mongod

      <br/>

      6. On another terminal (without closing the first one), run the command : node server.js

      <br/>

      7. To login as student - Go to localhost:3000/project/#/home .
      To login as TA - Go to localhost:3000/project/#/taHome .

      <h4> Breifing from P4</h4>

      <p>
      Hi, we are designing a Teaching Assistant Office Hours Management System (TOHMS).
          The purpose of this application is to allow students to book appointments with the TAs for their office hours visits.
          The TAs in turn can use the application to be give their availability and see information about booked appointments.

      Informed consent: We are conducting a study to find out what people think about this. We will not record or publish any information with your name.
          This is for a course we are taking in Human-Computer Interaction under Prof. David Sprague.
          Your participation is voluntary, and you can stop anytime and ask that your data not be used.
          It should take about 20 minutes to 30 minutes. Can you help us out with this?
      Awesome. The purpose of today&#39;s session is for you to help us figure out how to make this web interface more user-friendly before we finish developing it.
          But believe it or not, we are not going to use a computer.
          As you&#39;ll see, we have actually created paper versions of the screens, and my friend Keerthi will be playing the computer.
          If you want to do something, you&#39;ll need to interact with the prototype just as you would on a computer. Use your finger to click on buttons.
          These pieces of tape indicate places where you can type something in, and here&#39s your keyboard (give pen). It&#39s OK to write on this.
      Your job is to tell us what makes sense, what&#39;s confusing, whether it works the way you&#39;d expect it to.
      Keep in mind that we&#39;re testing the interface--we&#39;re not testing you--so if you run into any problems it&#39;s not your fault and it means that there&#39;s something we need to
          change.
          I&#39;ll be sitting next to you, and I can help you if you want.
      Please tell us what makes sense to you, what&#39;s confusing, and any questions that come to mind.
          Your questions are especially valuable, but I may not answer them right away because our goal is to change the interface, so it answers them.
      Remember that we&#39;re testing the interface--we&#39;re not testing you. Are you ready to start?
      OK, here is the first thing we&#39;d like you to do. Take a minute to read this and let me know if it makes sense.
          If so, then whenever you&#39;re ready please show us what you would do first.
      </p>

      In HW-2 of Database Management Systems course.

      You are having difficulty designing the database for the Assignment problem, specifically in terms of normalizing the tables.
      Use the TOHMS(TA Office Hours Management Application) to look for the next TA office hour session in the month of November
      and make an appointment for you and your friend .

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h5> <b>Task 2</b></h5>

      Your friend told you that he made an appointment on TOHMS for the same question already for
      the 22nd November, 2018 TA hour session. Use TOHMS to join the same.

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h5> <b>Task 3</b></h5>


      You are a teaching assistant for Database Management System course at NEU.
